# protein-unfolding
Here I explain some of the data analysis I performed as a part of my research project on protein mechanics.
In this project, I apply mechanical force to individual protein molecules (using a device called 'magnetic tweezers') and study how the molecule's behaviour responds to different forces. 

The experimental data obtained in these experiments can be ultimately used to predict how the protein behaves in the absence of any force (this information would be otherwise inaccessible because of a very long time scale of the protein unfolding events occurring under these conditions) as well as for extracting some information about the amounts of energy involved in the protein unfolding process. 

This repository contains two Jupiter notebook files and two .py files with the corresponding code:

The 'data-analysis-protein-unfolding' is the main file containing the analysis steps, and the 'data-preparation-magnetic-tweezers' contains some data preparation steps that I follow before starting the data analysis.
